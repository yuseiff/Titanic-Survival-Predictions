# Titanic-Survival-Predictions

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for training and evaluation is loaded from a CSV file named 'tested.csv' using the pandas library. After loading the dataset, initial data preprocessing steps are performed. The unnecessary columns 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' are dropped, and missing data is handled by filling the missing values in the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns with their respective medians. The 'Sex' column is transformed by replacing 'male' with 1 and 'female' with 0. 
Next, data visualization is performed using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The count of passengers by sex is displayed using a count plot, and the distributions of age and fare are visualized using histograms. Finally, a count plot shows the distribution of survival outcomes.
The dataset is then split into training, cross-validation, and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. The feature variables are stored in 'x_train', 'x_cv', and 'x_test', while the target variables (survived or not) are stored in 'y_train', 'y_cv', and 'y_test'. 
To ensure the features are on a similar scale, the features are standardized using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn. This step helps improve the performance of the logistic regression model.
The logistic regression model is trained using the fit() method from the LogisticRegression class in scikit-learn. The trained model is then evaluated on the training, cross-validation, and testing sets. The mean squared error (MSE) is calculated for each set, and the accuracy score is calculated using the accuracy_score() function. The accuracy scores provide an indication of how well the logistic regression model is performing in predicting the survival outcome.
In summary, this project demonstrates the process of predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a logistic regression model. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, data splitting, model training, and evaluation steps.
